Pongstar
==

This is a simple pong-like game, released under the Apache / Creative commons share-alike license.

The game is built in C# using Unity3d.

Enjoy!

If you've done a mix-up or forked it and done something interesting, drop me a line and let me know.


You can play it in the browser right now using the [Unity webplayer](https://raw.github.com/shadowmint/pongstar/master/media/webplayer/pongstar.html) or download it and play on
an android device from the Google Play Store (link coming soon!).

Note that while Unity3D has free licenses for desktop deployment, deploying to mobile devices requires
a non-free license from the Unity store. That's why there's no iOS build.
