About
--
This is a simple pong-like game, released under the Apache / Creative commons share-alike license.

If you've done a mix-up or forked it and done something interesting, drop me a line and let me know.

You can play it in the browser right now using the [Unity webplayer](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/shadowmint/pongstar/master/media/webplayer/pongstar.html)
or on an android device from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shadowmint.pongstar).

Note that while Unity3D has free licenses for desktop deployment, deploying to mobile devices requires
a non-free license from the Unity store. That's why there's no iOS build.

Freedom!

Is this game really really free? Well... not quite. All the code I've written is under the apache license, but the Unity3D engine is a closed
source product, so technically it's not entirely free.

However, there is a free version of Unity available, and you're welcome to take this code and do whatever you like with it!
