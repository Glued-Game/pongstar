Pongstar
==

This is a simple pong-like game, released under the Apache / Creative commons share-alike license.

The game is built in C# using Unity3d.

Enjoy!

If you've done a mix-up or forked it and done something interesting, drop me a line and let me know.


You can play it in the browser right now using the [Unity webplayer](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/shadowmint/pongstar/master/media/webplayer/pongstar.html)
an android device from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shadowmint.pongstar).

Note that while Unity3D has free licenses for desktop deployment, deploying to mobile devices requires
a non-free license from the Unity store. That's why there's no iOS build.
